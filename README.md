# Quant2-Recommendation-System
Developeded a movie recommendation system project using collaborative filtering. This project involved cleaning and preparing a dataset of user ratings, building a recommendation model using the Surprise library, and evaluating its performance. Additionally, we created a user interface with Tkinter to provide personalized movie recommendations based on individual user preferences. Visualizations were also developed to analyze rating distributions and user activity.
